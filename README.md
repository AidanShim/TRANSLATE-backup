# LArCADe
Simulation of electron transport in LAr for LArCADe at FNAL.

Basis of simulation outlined in Wojcik, M., & Tachiya, M. (2002). Electron transport and electron–ion recombination in liquid argon: Simulation based on the Cohen–Lekner theory. Chemical Physics Letters, 363(3-4), 381-388. doi:10.1016/s0009-2614(02)01177-6

## Getting Started
Running the executable for LArCADe will walk you through the parameters to be specified before simulation begins. The resulting data can be viewed through the Jupyter notebooks in the Python directory.

The notebooks will house additional explanatory comments as the project continues.

Gas cross-section data is from the BSR database, www.lxcat.net, retrieved on June 11, 2019 and Rejoub, R., Lindsay, B. G., & Stebbings, R. F. (2002). Determination of the absolute partial and total cross sections for electron-impact ionization of the rare gases. Physical Review A, 65(4). doi:10.1103/physreva.65.042713. Liquid cross-section data comes from the Wojcik, M., & Tachiya, M. paper mentioned at the top.

### Prerequisites
You'll need Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib. Jupyter is required to view the notebooks. CMake makes for an easy install.

### Installing
The usual. Navigate to the project directory in terminal, then type

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
